# Project scope
Main goal of this project is improve speed of testing our programs.
I redefine default input() function and now input() return next
lines of data from indicated file

# Install
1. Download custom_input.py
2. Put this file to your project
3. Change FILE_PATH const in custom_input.py
4. Import ```input``` function to your project 
   ```from custom_input import input```
5. Now input() will return next lines from your file :3
